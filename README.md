# Universal Code Quiz

## Description
Code quiz that is configurable with new questions. This is an easy to use code quiz site that can be used to study for any type of coding quiz. The is a one page site that dynamically moves in an out different screens for the user. Pre-loaded with sample questions for review for potential jobs.   

I was motivated to pursue this project to learn to the DOM and make use of JavaScript to master element traversal and manipulation. I built this project to add to my professional portfolio of projects and enhance my skill set. It allows the administrator to simply copy and paste new questions in for different quizzes. I learned a lot on this project including DOM navigation, Javascript eventListener functionality, advanced CSS, how to show and hide items effectively.
